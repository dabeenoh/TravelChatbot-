# AmexBot from scratch with numpy
A Deep Neural Network based chat bot built from scratch using numpy

## Test the chatbot

Run the chatbot in command line :
```python3 bot.py```
Type "quit" to quit the chatbot.
Type any questions about one of the 7 topics :
<ul>
    <li>Greeting</li>
    <li>Historical</li>
    <li>Food</li>
    <li>Animals</li>
    <li>Cruise</li>
    <li>Night tour</li>
    <li>Relaxation</li>
    <li>Show concerts</li>
</ul>

To get inspiration look at the csv file "Test.csv". You can start by asking questions from the file. The neural network hasn't been trained on a very exhaustive dataset, some unrelated questions or unknown words could be hard to understand for the chatbot.

## Look at the code
A raw python file coded in an object-oriented style can be found in "scratch.py".

A more comprehensive notebook can be found in "scratch_explained.ipynb" that explains in more detail the architecture of the deep neural network.

## Training process
Look at the results of the training in "train.ipynb"

Training process complexity. Graph of training time as a function of the training size.

## User load performance
Graph of prediction time as a function of the testing size.
